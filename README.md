Runtime-Monitoring-of-Diabetes-Using-ECG-Signals-and-Machine-Learning

Built a runtime system for glucose monitoring using ECG-derived features from wearable sensors.

Extracted key signals (HR, HRV, amplitude, confidence) from D1NAMO dataset and trained regression & classification models (Ridge, 
MLP, RF, DT).

Integrated outputs with temporal logic for real-time diabetes event detection, achieving high accuracy with a non-invasive pipeline.
